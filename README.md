# Feeling bubbly?

Welcome to the land of bubbles, where the sky's the limit. This is where you can
find additional [bubbles][bubbles] for the [Bubble Tea][bubbletea] library. This
repo and its affiliated bubbles are maintained by community members.

You can PR your completed projects to be included in the list. You're also
welcome to contribute ideas for new bubbles without building them out. 

## What is a "Complete" Project

A project is considered complete when:
1. It implements the minimum viable product for the idea
2. It includes a `README` with screenshots or a GIF showcasing the
   component. See [Freeze][freeze] or [VHS][vhs] for easy demos.
